# Suggestions for the data formats
## Tag acceleration
Files will be in .csv format with ';' as the delimiter. One file will contain data from one tag during one day from 00-00-00 till 23-59-59 or part of the day. The file name will have the format AccXYZ_YYYY-MM-DD_TagNNNN.csv, where NNNN is the number of the tag with the required number of digits and left 0 digits to keep all numbers in the same length. The file will include the time stamp in format HH-MM-SS.FFF, where HH is hours from 01 to 23 including the first 0 digit, MM are minutes including the first 0 digit, SS are seconds including the first 0 digit and FFF are milliseconds. The reference will be marked by a shortest distinguishable mark, for example, S is standing, L is lying, W is walking.
